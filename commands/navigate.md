## Navigation Process

1. **Search the indexes first** (see Index Search section below)
   - Extract key concepts from the question
   - Grep the indexes for those terms
   - If matches found → use those entries directly
2. **If no search matches, navigate by section**:
   - Read the index: `data/index.md`
   - Check for tiered index (if main index links to sub-indexes like `→ See [index-actions.md]`)
   - Find relevant section and read sub-index if tiered
3. **Parse path format**: `{source_id}:{relative_path}`
4. **Check for `⚡ GREP` marker** - if present, use Grep instead of Read (see Large Structured Files section)
5. **Look up source** in `data/config.yaml` by ID
6. **Get content** based on source type (see Source Access below)
7. **Answer** with citation to source and file path

---

## Index Search (Recommended First Step)

**Before reading sections sequentially, SEARCH the indexes for relevant terms.**

### Step 1: Extract Key Concepts

Analyze the user's question and extract:
- **Explicit terms**: Words directly used in the question
- **Synonyms**: Related terms (e.g., "filter" → also try "view", "query", "search")
- **Domain terms**: Technical concepts that might appear in docs (e.g., "tag" → also try "label", "field")

### Step 2: Search All Index Files

```bash
# Search for each term across all index files
grep -ri "{term}" data/ --include="*.md"
```

**Tip:** Search for the most specific term first. If no matches, broaden to synonyms.

### Step 2b: Search Entry Keywords (High Priority)

Index entries may have keyword lines for operational lookup:

```markdown
- **Entry Title** `source:path.md` - Description
  Keywords: `keyword1`, `keyword2`, `keyword3`
```

**Keyword matches are high-confidence** - if a user asks about a term and an entry has matching keywords, that's a direct hit.

### Step 3: Use Search Results (Priority Order)

If grep finds matches, prioritize in this order:

1. **Keyword match** (highest confidence): Entry has `Keywords:` line matching the search term → use that path immediately
2. **Direct description hit**: Entry description directly matches the question → use that path
3. **Related hit**: Entry is in the right area but doesn't directly answer → **GO TO STEP 4 IMMEDIATELY**
4. **No hit in index**: The topic may not be indexed → **GO TO STEP 4 IMMEDIATELY**

**CRITICAL: Use the EXACT path from the index! NEVER guess or invent filenames.**

### Step 4: Clarify Before Exploring (IMPORTANT!)

**STOP HERE if you only found related content, not a direct answer.**

Don't start exploring, guessing paths, or searching the source files. Instead, **use AskUserQuestion** to clarify:

**Present these options:**

1. **Clarify the request** - Maybe the question can be rephrased
   - "Could you rephrase your question? I searched for '{terms}' but found no matches."
   - Suggest alternative terms: "Did you mean '{synonym}' or '{related_term}'?"

2. **Show what's available** - Help the user find related content
   - "The closest sections I found are: {list nearby sections}"
   - "Would any of these help: {list related entries}?"

3. **Identify an index gap** - If the user confirms their request was valid
   - "This topic isn't covered in the current index."
   - Offer next steps:
     - `/hiivmind-corpus-flyio:navigate enhance {topic}` - Add depth to a specific topic area
     - `/hiivmind-corpus-flyio:navigate add source {url}` - Add another documentation source
     - `/hiivmind-corpus-flyio:navigate refresh` - Check if upstream docs have new content

## Tiered Index Navigation

Large corpora may use **tiered indexes** with a main index linking to detailed sub-indexes:

```
data/
├── index.md              # Main index with section summaries
├── sections/             # Detailed sub-indexes
│   ├── section-a.md
│   └── section-b.md
```

**How to navigate:**

1. **Start with main index** (`data/index.md`)
2. **Identify the relevant section** from user's question
3. **If section links to sub-index**: Read that sub-index for detailed entries
4. **Quick Reference entries** in main index have direct paths - use those for common lookups

---

## Path Format

Index entries use the format: `{source_id}:{relative_path}`

Examples:
- `flyio:reference/api.md` - Git source
- `local:team-standards/guidelines.md` - Local uploads
- `web:blog-posts/article.md` - Cached web content

---

## Source Access

### Worked Example (IMPORTANT - Follow This Pattern!)

**Index entry found:** `docs:guides/getting-started/index.md`

**Step 1 - Parse the path:**
- `source_id` = `docs` (everything before the colon)
- `relative_path` = `guides/getting-started/index.md` (everything after the colon)

**Step 2 - Look up source in config.yaml:**
```yaml
sources:
  - id: docs
    type: git
    repo_owner: example
    repo_name: docs
    branch: main
    docs_root: content
```

**Step 3 - Construct the full path:**
- Local clone: `.source/docs/content/guides/getting-started/index.md`
- GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/example/docs/main/content/guides/getting-started/index.md`

**CRITICAL:** The `relative_path` from the index is used EXACTLY as-is. NEVER invent or guess filenames!

### For git sources

**Step 1 - Check for local clone:**
Use Glob to check if `.source/{source_id}/` exists.

**Step 2a - If local clone exists (PREFERRED):**
Read directly from `.source/{source_id}/{docs_root}/{relative_path}` using the Read tool.

**Step 2b - If NO local clone exists (fallback only):**
Fetch from GitHub using the EXACT path from the index:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}/{branch}/{docs_root}/{relative_path}
```

### For generated-docs sources

**Step 1 - Look up source in config.yaml:**
```yaml
sources:
  - id: my-docs
    type: generated-docs
    web_output:
      base_url: https://example.com/docs
```

**Step 2 - Construct URL:** `{base_url}/{relative_path}`

**Step 3 - Fetch via WebFetch**

### For local sources

Read directly from: `data/uploads/{source_id}/{path}`

### For web sources

Read from cache: `.cache/web/{source_id}/{cached_file}`

If cache miss, look up the URL in `data/config.yaml` and fetch fresh content.

---

## Large Structured Files (schemas, specs, configs)

For large files like GraphQL schemas, OpenAPI specs, or JSON configs, **DO NOT read the entire file**. Use Grep to search precisely:

```bash
# Find a type definition
grep -n "^type {Name} " schema.graphql -A 30

# Find an endpoint
grep -n "/{path}" openapi.yaml -A 30
```

**When to use Grep vs Read:**
- File > 1000 lines → prefer Grep
- Looking for specific definition → Grep with `-A` context
- Need surrounding context → Grep with `-B` and `-A`

---

## File Locations

- **Index**: `data/index.md` (and `data/sections/*.md` if tiered)
- **Config**: `data/config.yaml` (has sources array with per-source tracking)
- **Git sources**: `.source/{source_id}/` (cloned repos, gitignored)
- **Local sources**: `data/uploads/{source_id}/` (user-uploaded files)
- **Web cache**: `.cache/web/{source_id}/` (fetched web content, gitignored)

---

## Output

- Cite the source ID and file path for reference
- Include code examples from the docs
- Suggest related docs from the same index section
- Note source type and freshness warnings if relevant

## Making Projects Aware of This Corpus

If you're working in a project that uses Fly.io but doesn't know about this corpus, you can add awareness to the project's CLAUDE.md.

**The `references/project-awareness.md` file** contains a ready-to-use snippet that can be added to any project's CLAUDE.md.

### When to Suggest Injection

Suggest adding project awareness when:
- User is working in a project that heavily uses Fly.io
- User repeatedly asks Fly.io questions without invoking the corpus
- User says "I keep forgetting to use the docs"

---

## Example Sessions

### Documentation Question

**User:** `/hiivmind-corpus-flyio:navigate how do I use feature X?`

1. Grep `data/` for "feature X"
2. Find entry like `flyio:guides/feature-x.md`
3. Read from `.source/flyio/./guides/feature-x.md`
4. Answer with code examples and link to source

---

## Corpus Maintenance

For corpus maintenance, use the parent plugin:

```
/hiivmind-corpus refresh flyio     - Update index from upstream
/hiivmind-corpus enhance flyio X   - Add depth to topic X
/hiivmind-corpus status flyio      - Check corpus freshness
```
